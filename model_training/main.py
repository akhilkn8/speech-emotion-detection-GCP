class ModelTrainerTrainingPipeline:
    """
    Class for model trainer training pipeline.

    Summary:
        This class represents the model trainer training pipeline.

    Explanation:
        The ModelTrainerTrainingPipeline class provides a main method to execute the model trainer training pipeline.
        It initializes the ConfigurationManager and retrieves the model trainer configuration.
        It then performs model training by calling the ModelTrainer class.

    Methods:
        main():
            Executes the model trainer training pipeline by initializing the ConfigurationManager and performing model training.

    Raises:
        Any exceptions that occur during the model trainer training pipeline.

    Examples:
        pipeline = ModelTrainerTrainingPipeline()
        pipeline.main()
